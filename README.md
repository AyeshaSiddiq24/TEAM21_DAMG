Library Management System (LMS) with ER Modeling, Transaction Management, and Security. 

Problem statement 
Libraries must manage large volumes of data, including book inventories, member information, borrow/return transactions, and fine calculations. Manual processes or poorly designed systems lead to data inconsistencies, inefficient operations, and potential security breaches. There is a need for an automated system that ensures data accuracy and security, particularly when multiple users interact with the system simultaneously. 

Business Rules
•	Each book must belong to single category.
•	A category can have multiple books.
•	Each book is located at a specific location in the library.
•	There may be more than one copy of a book owned by the library.
•	Members can borrow books but must have an active membership status to do so.
•	Books can only be issued if copies are available.
•	Library staff can see who has borrowed a particular book, who has checked out a book
in the past, when members have joined, type of membership and status of member.
•	Fines can be imposed on members if books are not returned within 15 days of
borrowing them. Members can pay the fines that have been added to their account.
